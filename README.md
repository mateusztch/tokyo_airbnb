# Tokyo Airbnb Data Analysis 🏯📊
Project Overview
While diving into Tokyo’s Airbnb market, I saw an exciting opportunity to uncover trends, create interactive visualizations, and build predictive models to better understand the dynamics of short-term rentals in one of the world's busiest cities. 🌏✨

To ensure a seamless analysis and visualization experience, I worked with datasets sourced from Inside Airbnb, performing in-depth explorations, processing data, and using machine learning to predict pricing trends. All analyses are anonymized, so you’re seeing a fully generalized version of the project!

Key Features
Data Exploration & Cleaning 🧹: Started with raw datasets and transformed them into actionable insights. Analyzed missing data, handled inconsistencies, and set the stage for rich visualizations.

Interactive Heatmaps 🗺️: Leveraged Folium to create geographic insights—exploring which neighborhoods are hotbeds for Airbnb activity and pricing.

Seasonality and Pricing Trends 📅💰: Studied how availability and pricing vary throughout the year, helping predict high-demand periods in Tokyo.

Machine Learning Models 🤖: Built and optimized predictive models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost to estimate Airbnb listing prices based on features.

Beautiful Visualizations 🎨: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create engaging, insightful visuals that make the data easy to interpret.

Technologies Used
Pandas & Numpy for data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
Folium for geographic heatmaps and spatial analysis
Machine Learning:
Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost for prediction
Statsmodels for statistical insights
Jupyter Notebook for seamless development and interactive exploration
The Process
Exploration & Cleaning 🕵️‍♂️:

Imported and explored datasets (calendar.csv & listings.csv).
Handled missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Visualization & Analysis 📈:

Uncovered trends in pricing, availability, and listing features.
Used heatmaps to reveal geographic insights.
Predictive Modeling 🔮:

Trained machine learning models to predict Airbnb pricing.
Iterated on models with grid search and hyperparameter tuning.
Interactive Maps 🌐:

Created dynamic maps to visualize pricing hotspots in Tokyo.
Why This Project?
I wanted to combine my love for data with the charm of Tokyo, exploring the nuances of its short-term rental market. This project was not only a deep dive into Airbnb data but also a chance to flex my data analysis, machine learning, and visualization skills. 🚀

Next Steps
Incorporate additional datasets for even richer insights (e.g., reviews, host data).
Enhance predictive models with more advanced features or external data like local events.
Build a streamlined dashboard for non-technical users to explore the insights.
This project was a blast to work on, and I hope it inspires you to look at Airbnb data—or any dataset!—with fresh curiosity. 🧠✨
