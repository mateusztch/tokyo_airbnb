# Tokyo Airbnb Data Analysis 🏯📊
Project Overview
This project dives into Tokyo's Airbnb market using real-world data to uncover trends, visualize patterns, and predict pricing. The aim is to better understand the dynamics of short-term rentals in one of the world’s most visited cities.

By analyzing anonymized Airbnb data, I identify key insights, map hotspots, and use ML to predict pricing.

Key Features
Data Exploration : Cleaned and analyzed datasets to uncover trends in availability, pricing, and seasonality.

Interactive Maps : Used Folium to create geographic heatmaps, highlighting popular neighborhoods and pricing patterns.

Seasonality Analysis : Explored how availability and pricing change across the year, identifying high-demand periods in Tokyo.

Predictive Modeling : Built MLM like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost to predict listing prices.

Data Visualizations : Leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visuals that communicate key insights effectively.

Technologies Used
Data Tools: Pandas, Numpy for data manipulation and cleaning.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium for charts, graphs, and interactive maps.
Machine Learning: Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Future Improvements
One key area for improvement is in handling geographic data. I plan to categorize latitude and longitude values into distance-based groups relative to Tokyo’s city center. 
This will allow for better spatial analysis and may uncover new patterns or insights related to pricing and availability based on proximity to central locations. 
This enhancement will also make it easier to integrate geographic features into predictive models.
