# Tokyo Airbnb Data Analysis 🏯📊
Project Overview
This project dives into Tokyo's Airbnb market using real-world data to uncover trends, visualize patterns, and predict pricing. The aim is to better understand the dynamics of short-term rentals in one of the world’s most visited cities.

By analyzing anonymized Airbnb data, we identify key insights, map hotspots, and use machine learning to predict pricing. It's a practical exploration of data science applied to real-life scenarios.

Key Features
Data Exploration 🔍: Cleaned and analyzed datasets to uncover trends in availability, pricing, and seasonality.

Interactive Maps 🗺️: Used Folium to create geographic heatmaps, highlighting popular neighborhoods and pricing patterns.

Seasonality Analysis 📅💰: Explored how availability and pricing change across the year, identifying high-demand periods in Tokyo.

Predictive Modeling 🤖: Built machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost to predict listing prices.

Data Visualizations 📊: Leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visuals that communicate key insights effectively.

Technologies Used
Data Tools: Pandas, Numpy for data manipulation and cleaning.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium for charts, graphs, and interactive maps.
Machine Learning: Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost for predictive modeling.
Statsmodels: For statistical exploration and hypothesis testing.
Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive and iterative analysis workflow.
The Process
