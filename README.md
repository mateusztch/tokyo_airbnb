# Tokyo Airbnb Data Analysis 🏯📊
Project Overview
This project dives into Tokyo's Airbnb market using real-world data to uncover trends, visualize patterns, and predict pricing. The aim is to better understand the dynamics of short-term rentals in one of the world’s most visited cities.

By analyzing anonymized Airbnb data, I identify key insights, map hotspots, and use ML to predict pricing.

Key Features

Interactive Maps : Used Folium to create geographic heatmaps, highlighting popular neighborhoods and pricing patterns.

Seasonality Analysis : Explored how availability and pricing change across the year, identifying high-demand periods in Tokyo.

Predictive Modeling : Built MLM like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost to predict listing prices.

Data Visualizations : Leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visuals that communicate key insights effectively.

Technologies Used
Data Tools: Pandas, Numpy for data manipulation and cleaning.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium for charts, graphs, and interactive maps.
